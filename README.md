## About me

Hi, I'm Lucas, I'm a Mechanical Engineering co-op student planning on specializing in Mechatronics who fell down the coding rabbit hole.
I am a member of Memorial Baja, a student team designing a Baja vehicle to race.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a tachometer-sensing script
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C for the tachometer sensing script for Baja
